# Challenge 1 - Counter App

Time to start Fluttering! 

First challenge is to modify the Flutter sample Counter app so it does the following:

- Decrement the Counter value

- Change the value's color when it's odd or even

## Goals

Hopefully, by the end of this challenge you'll learn about:

- ``TextStyle`` and its role for customizing the look of Text Widgets

- ``Column`` Widget and its ``crossAxisAlignment`` and ``mainAxisAlignment`` properties

- How to use ``setState`` to trigger changes in the app
